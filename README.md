# Fiji-Counting-Macro

This ImageJ Macro counts and quantifies the intensity of DAPI/CXCL8/YAP costained cells by counting DAPI stained cells (segmented with [interactive watershed](https://github.com/mpicbg-scicomp/Interactive-H-Watershed.git)) and assigning a positive brightness value threshold of the CXCL8 and YAP channels. Then cells in which CXCL8 and YAP respectively are expressed are quantified.
